# Premier-League-App
This desktop application that I made is actually a web scraper whose content and information are provided online and through scraping. In simpler words, this app, which 
I implemented with Python programming language, with the help of requests and BeautifulSoup libraries, sends requests to the official website of the Premier League at
the PremierLeague.com address with the help of CSS selectors and the content and information It receives in the form of HTML codes. Then it performs processes on them
and extracts and filters the required information from the HTML codes for display. To design the windows and the appearance of the app, I used the Qt Designer
application and the powerful PyQt5 library. Also, this app is accountable, which means that the user must first sign up and select his/her favorite club in Premier
League. After that, he/she can sign in the app and view information such as the latest status of the Premier League table, the players of his/her favorite club and their
individual statistics, the schedule of future matches of the league and also the statistics of his/her favorite club in the history of the Premier League. In addition,
the user can change his/her password or delete his/her account. To store user information in this app, I used PostgreSQL database locally. This means that the
information is only stored in the system, and if you want to run the app in your own system, you must install PostgreSQL. Also, due to the changes that may occur several
times in the HTML codes of the Premier League official website, it is necessary to update the codes related to the scraping part. I started doing this project 8 months
after getting to know the world of programming and at the beginning of the summer of 2021, and I finished it 3 months later, at the end of the summer. The challenges in
it strengthened several skills in me, including searching skills, and this point was very important for me. Finally, you can see some shots of the app below:
